# employee_tracker

this is my submission for the employee tracker. I used SQL + inquirer to implement this project. 

A demonstration video is attached here:

[Untitled_ Nov 19, 2023 2_44 PM.webm](https://github.com/peterkim1025/employee_tracker/assets/57886218/56d19c05-802f-4bf9-8186-30739d718478)

On this note, if the demonstration video doesn't work, can you message me instead of deducting points? I would not like to resubmit my assignment if possible. It seems like it only works on certain machine and I'm not sure why the previous grader couldn't open my demonstration video... Thanks in advance!
